# Development Log

## Session 2024-03-21 (15:30 EST)
- Implemented smoother spinning animation ([commit reference](https://github.com/getantonio/MindSet-Mastery)):
  - Created custom SpinningModifier and TimelineModifier for continuous rotation
  - Set two distinct speeds:
    - Recording: 2.0s rotation duration
    - Active (not recording): 8.0s rotation duration
  - Removed state-based rotation to eliminate jitter
  - Maintained audio level response (8x magnification)
  - Centered wheels with 33px right offset
  - Repository: https://github.com/getantonio/MindSet-Mastery
